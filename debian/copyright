This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of the FSF's GNU units
utility.  GNU 'units' program converts quantities expressed in various
scales to their equivalents in other scales.

This package was put together by me, James Troup <james@nocrew.org>,
from the GNU sources, which I obtained from
sunsite.doc.ic.ac.uk:/pub/gnu/units-1.54.tar.gz.

The current version of the package was obtained from 
ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/units
by John Hasler, the current Debian maintainer.


The changes were minimal:

o adding support for the Debian package maintenance scheme, by adding
  various debian/* files.
o units.c: #include <readline/history.h> iff READLINE is defined to
  get add_history() prototype.
o units.c: Added prototypes for handlesum(), completereduce() and
  compareunits().
o units.c (readunits,lookupunit,addunit,completeunits): parentheses
  around assignment used as a truth value.
o units.c (showanswer): initialize sep, right and left to quiet -Wall.
